# Cognitive Cities Foundry

An advanced distributed cognition system that treats the entire network as a Large Language Model (LLM) with tensor bundle channel multiplexing, namespace event loops, and topological partition resolution.

## 🌟 What is the Cognitive Cities Foundry?

The Cognitive Cities Foundry represents the pinnacle of Plan 9's distributed cognition architecture, implementing:

- **Tensor Bundle Channel Multiplexing**: Advanced multi-dimensional data routing across cognitive channels
- **Namespace Event Loops**: Transformer-like activation functions distributed across network namespaces  
- **Network Hypergraph Queries**: Graph-based representation and querying of network topology
- **Hopf Fibration Resolution**: Topological methods for resolving namespace partition conflicts
- **YACC-based Cognitive Grammar**: Natural language interface for network manipulation
- **Zero-Security Execution**: Unrestricted cognitive environments for maximum flexibility
- **Interactive Chat Interface**: Natural language control of the entire cognitive infrastructure

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Components

1. **CognitiveCity**: The main orchestrator containing all subsystems
2. **TensorBundle**: Multi-dimensional data structures with channel multiplexing
3. **NamespaceEventLoop**: Event-driven processing with transformer activations
4. **NetworkHypergraph**: Network topology representation and analysis
5. **InferenceEngine**: Core reasoning system with cognitive grammar parsing
6. **HopfFibration**: Topological conflict resolution for namespace partitions

### Advanced Features

- **Multi-scale Architecture**: Operates across base spaces (3D) and fiber spaces (2D)
- **Non-crossing Partitions**: Ensures topologically valid namespace divisions
- **Dynamic Resource Optimization**: Real-time cognitive density analysis
- **Grammar-driven Control**: YACC parser for complex command interpretation

## 🚀 Building and Running

### Prerequisites
- GCC compiler
- yacc (or bison)
- pthread library
- math library (libm)

### Build Commands

```bash
# Build the main system
make

# Build and run safe demo (recommended)
make demo-safe

# Build and run full demo with threading
make demo

# Clean build artifacts
make clean

# Show help
make help
```

### Running the Safe Demo

The safe demo version demonstrates all functionality without complex threading:

```bash

## 🧠 Cognitive Grammar

The system uses a YACC-based grammar for natural language interaction:

### Supported Commands

```
query hypergraph [target]          - Analyze network structure
modify namespace partition [name]  - Restructure namespace divisions
tensor multiplex channel [name]    - Route tensor data across channels
create inference reasoning [process] - Initialize reasoning processes
chat "message"                     - Broadcast to cognitive network
optimize resources [in namespace]  - Perform resource optimization
optimize zero-security execution environment - Configure unrestricted execution
```

### Example Session

```
🏙️ NeoTokyo> query hypergraph connectivity
🔍 Analyzing network connectivity...
  Total connections: 42

🏙️ NeoTokyo> tensor multiplex channel cognitive_layer
📡 Multiplexing tensor bundle channels: cognitive_layer

🏙️ NeoTokyo> chat "What is the current cognitive density?"
💬 Broadcasting: What is the current cognitive density?
   Response: Cognitive density: 0.87 across 3 active namespaces
```
